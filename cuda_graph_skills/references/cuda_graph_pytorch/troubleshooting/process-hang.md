# Process Hang

Note

This section covers debugging hanging or stuck processes when using CUDA graphs.

## Process Hangs During Teardown

### NCCL Communicator Destruction with Active CUDA Graphs

**Symptom** : Process hangs indefinitely during `destroy_process_group()` or at program exit when using CUDA graphs with NCCL operations.

**What it means** : NCCL communicator destruction is blocked waiting for CUDA graphs to be released first.

**Why it happens** : Starting from NCCL 2.26, the communicator destruction logic [polls until all CUDA graphs referencing the communicator are destroyed](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nccl/blob/v2.28.3-1/src/init.cc#L2157-L2160):
    
    
    // NCCL source: src/init.cc
    // And keep polling until all graphs referencing us die.
    while (comm->localPersistentRefs != 0) {
      NCCLCHECKGOTO(ncclCommPollCallbacks(comm, /*waitSome=*/true), ret, fail);
    }
    

This enforces a strict release order: **CUDA graphs must be destroyed before NCCL communicators**. The polling mechanism prevents launching CUDA graphs on an already-destroyed communicator, which would cause undefined behavior.

However, in complex PyTorch workloads, both CUDA graphs and NCCL communicators may be garbage-collected by Python, and there’s no guarantee on the destruction order. If the NCCL communicator is destroyed first while a CUDA graph still holds a reference, the destruction blocks forever.

**Example 1** : The following code hangs at `destroy_process_group()`:
    
    
    # torchrun --nproc_per_node=2 035.nccl-hang.v1.py
    import os
    os.environ["TORCH_NCCL_ASYNC_ERROR_HANDLING"] = "0"
    
    import torch
    
    rank = int(os.environ["RANK"])
    local_rank = int(os.environ["LOCAL_RANK"])
    torch.cuda.set_device(local_rank)
    torch.distributed.init_process_group(backend='nccl', device_id=local_rank)
    torch.distributed.barrier()
    
    x = torch.randn((32, 128), device="cuda")
    
    graph = torch.cuda.CUDAGraph()
    with torch.cuda.graph(graph):
        torch.distributed.all_reduce(x)
    
    graph.replay()
    
    # Won't hang if you add `del graph` or `graph.reset()` here
    torch.distributed.destroy_process_group()  # Hangs here!
    

**Example 2** : Global variables and class attributes are destroyed last during Python shutdown, after the NCCL communicator may have been finalized:
    
    
    # torchrun --nproc_per_node=2 035.nccl-hang.v2.py
    import os
    os.environ["TORCH_NCCL_ASYNC_ERROR_HANDLING"] = "0"
    
    import torch
    
    class CUDAGraphWrapper:
        graph = None  # Class attribute survives function scope
    
    def test():
        rank = int(os.environ["RANK"])
        local_rank = int(os.environ["LOCAL_RANK"])
        torch.cuda.set_device(local_rank)
        torch.distributed.init_process_group(backend='nccl', device_id=local_rank)
        torch.distributed.barrier()
    
        x = torch.randn((32, 128), device="cuda")
    
        CUDAGraphWrapper.graph = torch.cuda.CUDAGraph()
        with torch.cuda.graph(CUDAGraphWrapper.graph):
            torch.distributed.all_reduce(x)
    
        CUDAGraphWrapper.graph.replay()
        # No explicit destroy_process_group()
    
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        test()
        # Hangs at exit! The class attribute keeps graph alive
        # until after NCCL communicator destruction
    

Warning

DDP, FSDP, and Other Distributed Wrappers

The same issue affects any CUDA graph capturing NCCL operations from distributed wrappers like `DistributedDataParallel` (DDP), `FullyShardedDataParallel` (FSDP), or tensor parallelism libraries. If your training loop captures all-reduce, all-gather, or reduce-scatter operations into a graph, ensure the graph is released before process group teardown.

**How to fix** :

**Solution 1: Explicitly Release Graphs Before Communicator Destruction**

Ensure CUDA graphs are destroyed before calling `destroy_process_group()` or before program exit:
    
    
    # Release graph before destroying process group
    del graph  # or graph.reset()
    torch.distributed.destroy_process_group()  # Now works
    
    # For global/class-level graphs
    CUDAGraphWrapper.graph.reset()  # or = None
    

**Solution 2: Use` atexit` Handler for Cleanup**

Use an `atexit` handler to ensure graphs are released before Python shutdown finalizes NCCL:
    
    
    import atexit
    
    graphs_to_cleanup = []
    
    def cleanup_graphs():
        for g in graphs_to_cleanup:
            g.reset()
        graphs_to_cleanup.clear()
    
    atexit.register(cleanup_graphs)
    
    # Register graphs for cleanup
    graph = torch.cuda.CUDAGraph()
    graphs_to_cleanup.append(graph)
    

## Debugging Hanging Processes

When a process hangs, use GDB with Python debug symbols to inspect native call stacks:
    
    
    # Install debug symbols (Ubuntu/Debian)
    sudo apt install python3-dbg gdb
    
    # Attach to hanging process
    gdb -p <process_id>
    
    # Inside GDB, get Python stack trace
    (gdb) py-bt
    

This is particularly useful for debugging hangs in native CUDA or NCCL code.
